              UNIT is the first index-based pure unit of account, a
              community-managed benchmark tied to global population data. UNITâ€™s
              unbiased measure of value makes it a prime candidate to take on
              the new era. We envision a future in which we cease to depend on
              central bank fiat money to exchange value as value becomes
              increasingly more decentralized and disintermediated. set.

              UNIT is a benchmark that serves two purposes. First, it serves as
              an index similar to the S&P500 to benchmark portfolios. However,
              UNIT is also a unit of value. Without being a currency, UNIT is
              used to price coins accurately. The Unit is a changing set of top
              cryptocurrencies and algorithmically creates UNIT, which tracks
              the performance of the set.

              UNIT (value unit created by The Unit) cannot be bought or sold.
              However, we are also creating a UNIT (token) to hold the value
              contained in the unit of account.
